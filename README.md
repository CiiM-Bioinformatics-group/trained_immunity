# trained_immunity
R scripts of trained immunity scRNA-seq projects 

### load and cluster the in vitro data
loading_and_clustering.R

### get expressed genes from a seurat object (default in > 10% of the cells) 
get_expressed_genes.R

### Codes to generate the merged violin plots
ViolinPlots.R

### heatmap and clustering based on trained immunity signatures
TrainedSubsets.R

### calculate the cellproprotion of trained cells
cellproportion.R

### analyses for the in vivo data
invivo_data.R

### data accessibility:  
Raw scRNA-seq data has been deposited at the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), under accession number E-MTAB-9702;  
Seurat object with count matrix and metadata has been deposited in Cloud service of Helmholtz Center: https://nubes.helmholtz-berlin.de/s/nwkJ3XECGMcx4yo,  
with an extract key as "TrainedImmunityHZI"
